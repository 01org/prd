PRD: The Persistent RAM Driver
==============================

Yet another Persistent RAM Driver.  This driver is not intended to go upstream
in its current state, and is instead meant as a development tool.

PRD is basically a modified version of the Block RAM Driver, BRD.  The major
difference is that BRD allocates its backing store pages from the page cache,
whereas PRD uses reserved memory that has been ioremapped.  The benefit of this
approach is that there is a direct mapping between filesystem block numbers and
virtual addresses.

In PRD, filesystem blocks N, N+1, N+2, etc. will all be adjacent in the virtual
memory space.  This property will hopefully allow us to set up PMD mappings (2
MiB) for XIP.

To use PRD, you need to set up some reserved memory for it.  Here are the
additions I made for my system with 64 GiB of RAM:

1. Reserve memory via the "memmap" kernel parameter in grub 1's menu.lst:
	
<pre>
title		Debian GNU/Linux, kernel 3.13.0+
root		(hd1,0)
kernel		/boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0+ root=UUID=fbb9c4ad-ca73-481d-affc-b0230f262333 ro memmap=32G$32G
initrd		/boot/initrd.img-3.13.0+
</pre>

2. Set up the correct kernel configuration options for PRD in .config.
	
<pre>
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PMEM=m
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PMEM_START=32
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PMEM_COUNT=4
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PMEM_SIZE=32
</pre>

This configuration gave me four pmem devices, each with 8 GiB of space:
	
<pre>
